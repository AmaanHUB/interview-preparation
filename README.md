# Interview Preparation

* The STAR (or STARR) method should be used where possible with these questions and answers

## DevOps

* **Insert modified Elevators Pitch here**, should include what DevOps is and why DevOps in the first place
	* Check the why DevOps section in this, maybe  rewrite third paragraph

Hello, my name is Amaan Hashmi-Ubhi and I've recently graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Science from the University of Birmingham, where I undertook a year in computer science. I have been using Linux for around 4 years, 3 of those exclusively and have found that my interests lean towards computing rather than medical research, mainly because I can learn and practice from home which is not currently possible in my area of medical research.

I have built my PC which uses Arch Linux and have a server running Fedora Server Edition of an old laptop, which I run BOINC, seed Linux distributions and use as a remote backup; with many exciting projects to come. I have been running Fedora to familiarise myself with RedHat distributions that are common throughout the industry whilst being rolling-relase so it is reasonably up-to-date, whereas I use Arch as you build it from the ground up and get to know many aspects of Linux which excites me.

My skills currently focus on the operations side of computing, though I am enthusiastic about moving into DevOps because of its often tight integration with Linux and the opportunity to learn new tools and ways of thinking, as well as bridging the historically large gap between software and operations. DevOps also focuses on automation and efficiency that I am keen to embrace as I have in the past, by making shell scripts that update my vim plugins, for example.

Additionally, I have developed a variety of soft skills such as conflict resolution and decision making throughout my university career due to securing leadership roles as treasurer, chair and teaching assistant in a Kung Fu Society and the CTO in the Birmingham Medical Research Society.

## Agile And Scrum

* **What is Agile?**
	* Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
		* **Manifesto for Agile:**
			* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
			* Working software over comprehensive documentation
			* Customer collaboration over contract negotation
			* Responding to change over following a plan
* **What is Scrum?**
	* Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together, which encourage them to learn through experiences, self-organisation whilst working on a problem, and reflection on their wins and losses to continuously improve.
* **Difference between Agile and Scrum?**
	* Agile is a model of continuous iteration of development and testing whereas Scrum is a methodology that is an implementation of Agile that focuses on delivering the business value in the shortest amount of time.
* **What are the 3 amigos?**
	* Primary perspectives to examine an increment of work before, during, and after development. These include:
		* *Business*:
			* What problem are we trying to solve?
		* *Devlopment*:
			* How might we build a solution tp solve that problem?
		* *Testing*:
			* What could possibly happen?
	* *Benefits:*
		* Shared understanding about the intent of an increment of work
		* Identifies misunderstandings and confusion early and allows learning to happen sooner in the delivery of an increment of work
		* Provides a limit to the number of people who should be involved in discussions about any given increment of work
* **What are personas in Scrum?**
* **What are Scrum artifacts, Scrum roles?**
* **What are Sprints and Sprint Reviews?**
* **User and Epic Stories?**
* **Difference between and use cases between V-model, Waterfall, and Agile?**
