Hello, my name is Amaan Hashmi-Ubhi and I've recently graduated with a BSc in Biomedical Science from the University of Birmingham, where I undertook a year in computer science. I have been using Linux for around 4 years, 3 of those exclusively and have found that my interests lean towards computing rather than medical research, mainly because I can learn and practice from home which is not currently possible in my area of medical research.

I have built my PC which uses Arch Linux and have a server running Fedora Server Edition of an old laptop, which I run BOINC, seed Linux distributions and use as a remote backup; with many exciting projects to come. I have been running Fedora to familiarise myself with RedHat distributions that are common throughout the industry whilst being rolling-relase so it is reasonably up-to-date, whereas I use Arch as you build it from the ground up and get to know many aspects of Linux which excites me.

My skills currently focus on the operations side of computing, though I am enthusiastic about moving into DevOps because of its often tight integration with Linux and the opportunity to learn new tools and ways of thinking, as well as bridging the historically large gap between software and operations. DevOps also focuses on automation and efficiency that I am keen to embrace as I have in the past, by making shell scripts that update my vim plugins, for example.

Additionally, I have developed a variety of soft skills such as conflict resolution and decision making throughout my university career due to securing leadership roles as treasurer, chair and teaching assistant in a Kung Fu Society and the CTO in the Birmingham Medical Research Society.
